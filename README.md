# Share your research questions!

One practice of working with the garage door open is sharing your research questions.

That way you allow others to see what you're working on and if they do the same we can build a diagram of interrelated questions, and spot oportunities for working together.

## How it works

You maintain a local research-questions.yml file:

```yml
author: Your name
contact: your@email.com https://other.way.of.contacting.you
questions:
  - Why one?
  - Why two?
following:
  - https://blabla.com
  - https://blibli.com
```

Once you do that, place your file in a cloud storage system that allows direct link sharing, or serve it up in your own server if you have one.

Now share your file's raw file URL with your peers, so that they add it to their 'following' list. Optionally, you can also send a PR to update `linkbook.txt` with your URL.

## Practical info

On Google Drive, right click on the file and add link sharing (anyone with the link has access), also copy the URL which will be something like `https://drive.google.com/file/d/XXX/view?usp=sharing`. Now that means that the URL to your research questions that you need to share is: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=XXX`.

If you have instructions on how to get the raw URL to the file in other common cloud providers please submit a PR.
